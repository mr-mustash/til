# Taking Daily Notes with the TIL Format
Today I happen to click on a link for Monica Powell's article "Your future self will thank you: Building your personal documentation" and it led me to @jbranchaud's [til](github.com/jbranchaud/til) repository. Given the way that I work and how my brain likes to pick up snippets of information this seemed like a good idea to try out.

### Notes
I don't know if I'm going to stick with this ever day (as in: not on weekends or vacation) but I'm certainly going to give it a go.
