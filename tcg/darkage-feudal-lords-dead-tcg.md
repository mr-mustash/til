# Dark Age - Failed TCG
Dark Age is a failed TCG from 1996. It had art elements that were very reminiscent to Mad Max, and the overall theme was very post apocalyptic. It is now very obscure with very few references to it left online, and even less availability on eBay.

### Notes:
I've always had a passing interest in failed TCGs and CCGs and today I found out about the game [Dark Age](https://wikiless.org/wiki/Dark_Age_(card_game)?lang=en) from an Alpha Investment's [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqoSM-EyqYg) video on the set is a very interesting look at the history of failed TCGs. Before this I have been interested in [Wyvern](https://wikiless.org/wiki/Wyvern_(card_game)?lang=en) and [Argent Saga](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/argentsagatcg/argent-saga-trading-card-game).
